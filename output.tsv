[Desscription]	Cardiolipin (CL) is a mitochondrial signature phospholipid that plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial function, including membrane structure, oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production, mtDNA biogenesis, mitochondrial fusion, fission, and autophagy (mitophagy).	[oxidative]	CL is highly sensitive to oxidative damage of its four fatty acyl chains by ROS, due to its high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids and exclusive location in mitochondria which are the primary intracellular source of ROS production (Lin & Beal, 2006).	[oxidative] [aging]	Aging is associated with oxidative stress and CL depletion (Hsu & Shi, 2017)	[oxidative] [complex I] [MPTP]	CL oxidation impairs mitochondrial complex I activity, which is implicated in neurotoxicity and apoptosis in 1©\methyl©\4©\phenyl©\1,2,4,6©\tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice (Perier et al., 2005).	[peroxidation] [oxidative]	In direct support of a causative role of CL peroxidation in the development of PD, mitochondrial©\targeted antioxidants attenuate pathogenesis and protect CL from oxidative damage in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases (Fouret et al., 2015; McManus, Murphy, & Franklin, 2011; Skulachev et al., 2010).	[Desscription]	Cardiolipin is also required for the various stages of the autophagic process, from autophagosome biogenesis to lysosomal function (Hsu et al., 2015; Hsu & Shi, 2017).	[electron transport] [ubiquinone] [complex I]	PINK1 mutations lead to lower levels of CL in mitochondria, whereas restoration of CL prevents mitochondrial dysfunction in flies by promoting electron transport between ubiquinone and complex I (Vos et al., 2017).	[Desscription]	CL deficiency has also been implicated in aging and other aging©\related neurological diseases (Hsu & Shi, 2017)	[lysocardiolipin] [remodeling]	ALCAT1 is an acyltransferase that catalyzes resynthesis of CL from lysocardiolipin, a key step involved in the remodeling of CL (Cao, Liu, Lockwood, Burn, & Shi, 2004).	[oxidative] [remodeling] [DHA] [AA]	Recent work showed that CL remodeling by ALCAT1 plays a key role in promoting oxidative stress by catalyzing the remodeling of CL with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) (Li et al., 2010)	[DHA] [AA] [oxidative]	DHA and AA are enriched with double bonds which render CL highly sensitive to oxidation by ROS.	[oxidative] [ROS] [peroxidation]	CL oxidation generates lipid peroxides, a more stable form of ROS, leading sequentially to exacerbation of oxidative stress, CL peroxidation and depletion, and mitochondrial dysfunction.	[ALCAT1] [remodeling]	Upregulated ALCAT1 mRNA and protein expression have implicated in the pathogenesis of several aging©\related metabolic diseases by catalyzing pathological remodeling of CL with a high peroxidation index (Li et al., 2012)	[regulating] [¦Á©\synuclein]	CL on the outer mitochondrial membrane plays a key role in regulating ¦Á©\synuclein stability (Ryan et al., 2018).	[remodeling] [peroxidation]	ALCAT1 is the first acyltransferase that catalyzes the pathogenic remodeling of CL with very long polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to CL peroxidation and depletion in several aging©\related diseases (Li et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2015).	[oxidative]	CL is also required for multiple processes of mitophagy in addition to its pivotal role in supporting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Hsu et al., 2015; Hsu & Shi, 2017).	[remodeling] [MAM]	CL oxidation by ROS stimulates its externalization to the mitochondrial surface, which not only triggers CL remodeling at the mitochondria©\associated membrane (MAM) by ALCAT1, but also serves as the key recognition signal for mitophagy (Chu et al., 2014; Hsu & Shi, 2017).	[enzymes]	CL is required for the activity of multiple enzymes involved in the mitochondrial fission and fusion process which plays a key role in mitochondrial quality control process (Chu et al., 2014; Hsu & Shi, 2017).	[complex I] [MPTP] [peroxides]	Inhibition of complex I activity by MPTP is accompanied by an increased production of CL peroxides (Perier et al., 2005).	[complex I] [oxidative] [cytochrome c]	Deficits of complex I also stimulate intramitochondrial oxidative stress, further exacerbating oxidative damage of CL. As a consequence of the vicious cycle, oxidized CL dissociates from cytochrome c, triggering the onset of apoptosis (Lutter et al., 2000; Petrosillo, Ruggiero, & Paradies, 2003).	[¦Á©\synuclein]	A recent study implicated a key role of CL in regulating autophagic degradation of aggregated ¦Á©\synuclein with PD (Ghio et al., 2016).
